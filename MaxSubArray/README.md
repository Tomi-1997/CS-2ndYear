# Maximum-Sub-Array
Visual representation for Kadane's Algorithm for the maximum sub array problem, using StdDraw.
Starting with current sum = best sum = 0 at start.
For each element, we take the maximum between : previous sum with the element OR the best sum until then.

Here is a three minute gif to demonstrate the algorithm:
