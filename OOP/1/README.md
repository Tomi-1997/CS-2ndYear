# Ex1_OOP
This is our version of designing a program which simulates a building with a number of elevators and a timeframe in which many calls between floors are allocated to certain elevators based on a 'cost' principle. 
For each call, we iterate our list of elevators and calculate how much time each person (call) inside an elevator will have to 'pay' and sum them, the 
cheapest elevator is then allocated to the call.

Graphical simulation of B2 with Calls_a:
In this simulation, each iteration simulates one second.

Graphical simulation of B4 with Calls_D:
In this simulation, each iteration simulates 40 seconds for the sake of seeing the elevators progress
